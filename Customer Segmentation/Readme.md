# Retail Store Customer Segmentation Project

Welcome to the Retail Store Customer Segmentation Project! This project focuses on understanding customer behavior through clustering analysis to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction. Below is a brief overview of the project:

## Overview:
In this project, we analyze customer data from a retail store to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing habits. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically clustering algorithms, we aim to group customers with similar behavior patterns together. This segmentation allows for targeted marketing efforts tailored to each customer segment.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** The initial step involves cleaning and preprocessing the raw customer data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Clustering Analysis:** We use clustering algorithms such as K-means or hierarchical clustering to group customers based on various features like purchase frequency, spending amount, demographic information, etc.
- **Cluster Profiling:** After forming clusters, we profile each cluster to understand the unique characteristics and preferences of customers within each group.
- **Targeted Marketing Strategies:** Insights gained from cluster profiling enable the development of targeted marketing strategies to cater to the specific needs and preferences of each customer segment.

## File Structure:
- **data/:** Contains the raw and processed customer data files.
- **scripts/:** Includes Python scripts for data preprocessing, clustering analysis, and cluster profiling.
- **results/:** Stores visualizations, summary reports, and insights generated from the analysis.
- **README.md:** This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the file structure.
